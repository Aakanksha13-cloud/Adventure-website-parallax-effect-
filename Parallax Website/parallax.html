            <h3>BIKING</h3>
           
        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <p class="text">Biking or motorcycling is riding in its purest form. Often associated with big motorcycles sporting knobby tires, adventure riding simply means venturing into the unknown on two wheels.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are a few things that separate adventure riding from other forms of motorcycling. Though your lane-splitting commute through rush hour traffic may feel like an adventure, ADV riding is different. To be on an adventure ride, you need to be self-reliant and focused on exploration. Just like overlanding, the journey, rather than the destination, is what it is all about. Whether you hit the road for an afternoon or a decade, your bike is the tool, and your experience is the goal.

        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <p class="text">Surfing, sport of riding breaking waves towards the shore, particularly by means of a board. Surfing's roots dwell pre-modern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the game was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Organized competitions helped to counter this negative image and to win surfing some social respectability.

            <br>
            India's 7500 kilometre coastline provides several spots for surfboarding. The largest waves are typically seen between May and September, the pre-monsoon and monsoon season. Waters of India are already well-liked for hosting a range of adventure sports like rafting, kayaking, sailing, stream crossing, and plenty of others. One such upcoming sport is Surfing in India. The western coast is great for beginners to get acquainted with a surfboard, whereas eastern shores have stronger currents and harder wave breakpoints.
